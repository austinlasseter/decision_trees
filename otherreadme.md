# decision_trees

Prepare a short 30 minute lecture on what a decision tree is, and how you would apply such a model to solve a ML problem. Assume that the target audience is a software developer with minimal prior exposure to machine learning.   
This means that they will be very comfortable with code, familiar but low comfort with mathematics, and comfortable with only core concepts like the bias-variance trade-off in machine learning. If you need to make additional assumptions about your audience, make note of them before the presentation begins.  
This presentation is primarily designed to assess pedagogical skill.
